## Virtual Diabetes Clinic Triage

### Description
The project is based on developing a small machine learning (ML) service that can predict how a disease will change in the short term and provide a continuous risk score. The risk score allows users to quickly and easily prioritize follow-ups. In other words, this model makes it easier for users to determine which patients need to be given priority.
