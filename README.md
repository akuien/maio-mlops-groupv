# Assigment 3 â€“ MLOps

## Virtual Diabetes Clinic Triage

### Description
#### Description
The project is based on developing a small machine learning (ML) service that can predict how a disease will change in the short term and provide a continuous risk score. The risk score allows users to quickly and easily prioritize follow-ups. In other words, this model makes it easier for users to determine which patients need to be given priority.

### Project main objectives
1. Develop a machine learning model that estimates risks and automatically assesses short-term disease progression.
2. Create an API service that allows users to request risk predictions for patient data.
3. The system will be implemented in a pipeline through Github Actions to automate testing, development, and launch of the service
